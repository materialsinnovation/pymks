# Overview

### MKS

The Materials Knowledge Systems (MKS) is a novel data science approach
for solving multiscale materials science problems. It uses techniques
from physics, machine learning, regression analysis, signal processing,
and spatial statistics to create structure-property-processing
relationships. The MKS carries the potential to bridge multiple
length scales using localization and homogenization linkages, and
provides a data driven framework for solving inverse material design
problems.

### PyMKS

The Materials Knowledge Materials in Python (PyMKS) framework is an
object oriented set of tools and examples written in Python that
provide high level access to the MKS framework for rapid creation and
analysis of structure-property-processing relationships. A short
intoduction of how to use PyMKS is outlined below and example cases can
be found [in the examples section](EXAMPLES.html). Both code and
example contributions are welcome.
