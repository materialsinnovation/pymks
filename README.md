## Overview

The Materials Knowledge Systems (MKS) is a novel data science approach
for solving multiscale materials science problems. It uses techniques
from machine learning, regression analysis, signal processing, and
spatial statistics to create structure-property-processing
relationships. The MKS carries the potential to both bridge multiple
length scales (using localization) and provide a framework for solving
the inverse material design problem.

## PyMKS

The PyMKS framework is an object oriented set of tools and examples
written in Python that provides high level access to the MKS method
for rapid analysis of microstructure-property relationships. A
description of how to use PyMKS is outlined below and example cases
can be found [in the examples section](EXAMPLES.html). Both code and
example contributions are welcome.
