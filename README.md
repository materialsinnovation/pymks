# Overview

### MKS

The Materials Knowledge Systems (MKS) is a novel data science approach
for solving multiscale materials science problems. It uses techniques
from physics, machine learning, regression analysis, signal processing,
and spatial statistics to create processing-structure-property
relationships. The MKS carries the potential to bridge multiple
length scales using localization and homogenization linkages, and
provides a data driven framework for solving inverse material design
problems.

### PyMKS

The Materials Knowledge Materials in Python (PyMKS) framework is an
object-oriented set of tools and examples, written in Python, that
provide high-level access to the MKS framework for rapid creation and
analysis of structure-property-processing relationships. A short
introduction to how to use PyMKS is outlined below and example cases can
be found [in the examples section](EXAMPLES.html). Both code and
examples contributions are welcome.
