    """
    `MKSStructureAnalysis` computes the 2-point statistics for a set of
    microstructures and does dimensionality reduction. It can be used to
    evaluate the selection of spatial correlations and look at clustering of
    2-point statistics.

    Attributes:
        n_components: Number of components used by `dimension_reducer`.
        dimension_reducer: Instance of a dimensionality reduction class.
        correlations: spatial correlations to be computed
        basis: instance of a basis class
        reduced_fit_data: Low dimensionality representation of spatial
            correlations used to fit the components.
        reduced_transformed_data: Reduced of spatial correlations.
        periodic_axes: axes that are periodic. (0, 2) would indicate that
            axes x and z are periodic in a 3D microstrucure.
        transformed_correlations: spatial correlations transform into the Low
            dimensional space.



    Below is an example of using MKSStructureAnalysis using FastICA.
